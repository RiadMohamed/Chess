# Chess
Chess game for Agile course CSE328.

We were asked to develop a Chess game across all 4 major platforms {Android, iOS, web, desktop} and I was the iOS dev team leader. We created a game that first welcome the user with a cross-platform unified welcome screen that adds the ability to add future features to the game (1vs1 and theme selection) however it only supports 2 players. The game allows the user to move the pieces using the pan gesture and would highlight the tile of any enemy piece that can be taken out, supports game checks in case the king was under threat as well.
